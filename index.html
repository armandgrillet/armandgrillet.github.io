		<p> <!-- Description -->
			Hi there! I'm Armand, a French engineering manager who works in Germany. I love coaching people, pair-programming, and learning about how cloud computing works.
		</p>
		<p> <!-- Current work -->
			I currently work at <a href="https://grafana.com" target="_blank">Grafana Labs</a>, in the cloud backend team. I manage the Query squad, working on adding new APIs and query languages to Prometheus, and the Alerting squad, focusing on the <a href="https://grafana.com/blog/2021/06/14/the-new-unified-alerting-system-for-grafana-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank">new unified alerting experience in Grafana</a>.
		<p> <!-- Previous work -->
			I previously worked at <a href="https://d2iq.com/" target="_blank">D2iQ (formerly Mesosphere)</a>. I have been senior software engineer in the Kubernetes Platform team and engineering manager in the Cluster Ops team. I worked on <a href="https://github.com/apache/mesos" target="_blank">Apache Mesos</a> and as a SRE before that.
		</p>
		<p> <!-- Volunteering -->
			During my free time, I led until early 2021 the European tech team at <a href="https://www.volteuropa.org/" target="_blank">Volt Europa</a>. I managed the contributors working on the tools we need to grow as a non-profit: the team, event, and newsletter management systems. The tools we developed supported more than 25000 members in 30 countries.
		</p>
		<p> <!-- Studies -->
			I have previously followed a European Master’s Programme with a major in <a href="https://masterschool.eitdigital.eu/cloud-and-network-infrastructures" target="_blank">Cloud Computing</a> and a minor in Innovation & Entrepreneurship.
			During this program, I have written <a href="files/MasterThesis.pdf" target="_blank">a master thesis</a> for the <a href="https://www.snet.tu-berlin.de/menue/service_centric_networking/welcome/" target="_blank">Service-centric Networking department</a> of TU Berlin and done multiple internships, including one for the <a href="https://www.inria.fr/en/" target="_blank">INRIA</a>.
